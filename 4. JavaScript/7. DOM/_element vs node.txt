🧱 Node
````````
● A Node is the base class for all DOM objects.
● It can represent:
  → Element nodes (<div>, <p>, etc.)
  → Text nodes (the text inside elements)
  → Comment nodes (<!-- comment -->)
  → Document nodes (document)


🧩 Element
``````````
● An Element is a type of Node — specifically, it represents an HTML tag.
● Examples: <div>, <p>, <a>, <span>, etc.

📌 Think of it like: "Everything in the DOM is a Node, but not every Node is an Element."
